# 📝 Commit Convention – java-dsa-forge

This file documents the commit message style used in this repository.  
The goal is to keep commit history clean, consistent, and easy to scan.

---

## 🔑 Format

Use one of the following prefixes:

- **progress:** daily work on problems/topics
- **notes:** updates to conceptual notes or documentation
- **refactor:** improvements or cleanup in code
- **milestone:** completion of a major section/topic
- **chore:** maintenance tasks (gitignore, folder reorg, etc.)

---

## 📘 Examples

- `progress: arrays – implemented binary search`
- `progress: recursion – solved N-Queens`
- `notes: strings – added complexity analysis`
- `refactor: linked list – optimized reversal`
- `milestone: arrays – searching section done`
- `chore: updated .gitignore`

---

## ✅ Guidelines

- Keep commit titles **short and descriptive** (50–72 characters).
- Use the body (optional) for details like complexity, pitfalls, or references.
- Prefer **one logical change per commit** (don’t mix multiple topics).
- Stay consistent — even small daily commits should follow the format.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This convention ensures:
- Clear daily progress tracking
- Easy revision of solved problems
- Professional, readable commit history for interviews and collaboration
